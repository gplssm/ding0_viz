Visualization of synthetic medium-voltage grid data generated with [ding0](https://dingo.readthedocs.io).
Ding0 is software package created as part of the research project [open_eGo](https://openegoproject.wordpress.com).
Based on open data, ding0 reverse-engineers the topology of medium-voltage and low-voltage electricity distribution grids for the entire Germany. Check-out the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/openego/ding0).
